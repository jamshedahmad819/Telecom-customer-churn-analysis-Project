# Telcom Customer Churn Analysis (SQL + Power BI Project)

---

# 1. Project Overview

Customer churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers stop using their services. In this project, I analyzed a telecom company's customer data using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization.

Goal of this project:

• Identify customers who churned

• Find factors affecting churn

• Calculate churn rate and KPIs

• Help business improve customer retention

This project simulates a real-world business scenario where a data analyst supports management in reducing churn and improving revenue.


# 2. Business Problem

Telecom companies lose customers due to pricing, poor service, contract flexibility, or lack of support. Customer retention is very important because acquiring new customers is more expensive than keeping existing ones.

Business questions answered:

• What is the overall churn rate?

• Which contract type has highest churn?

• Do high monthly charges increase churn?

• Does tech support reduce churn?

• Which payment method has highest churn?

• Which services increase churn risk?

# 7. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

• Total Customers: 7043
• Total Churned Customers: 1869
• Churn Rate: 26.54%

Churn Rate Formula:

Churn Rate = Churned Customers / Total Customers × 100

# 8. Key Insights from Analysis

Based on SQL and Power BI analysis:

1. Overall churn rate is 26.54%, with 1869 customers churned out of 7043.

2. Gender does not affect churn significantly. Male and female customers have almost the same churn rate.

3. Contract type is a major factor. Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn rate compared to one-year and two-year contracts.

4. Tech support plays an important role. Customers without tech support have significantly higher churn rate.

5. Monthly charges affect churn. Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.

6. Phone service customers have higher churn count compared to customers without phone service.

7. Payment method affects churn. Customers using electronic check have the highest churn rate, while customers using credit card have the lowest churn rate.

# 9. Business Recommendations

Based on insights:

• Encourage customers to choose yearly or long-term contracts

• Provide better tech support services

• Reduce high monthly charges or offer discounts

• Encourage customers to use credit card payment

• Identify high-risk customers early

These actions can help reduce churn and increase customer retention.
